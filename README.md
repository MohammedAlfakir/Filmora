Filmora - Your Streaming Platform is a streaming service where you can watch the latest movies and see your favorite actors.

In this project, I learned how to use the MERN stack easily and how to deploy it on the web.

In this project, I’m using: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and JWT.

I’m fetching data from TMDB and have also added a search filter for actors, movies, and trailer videos.
